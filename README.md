> Introduction
In this notebook we will be analysing the Crime Incident Reports of the city of Boston, US, from June 2015 to January 16, 2019. This report is provided by the Boston Police Department (BPD) "to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond" Source.
Since there are more than 350k events registered in this dataset, we will only be focusing at the incidents related to motor vehicles.

>We will be using Python and some of its data science libraries, namely:NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium.



## Summary of Findings
